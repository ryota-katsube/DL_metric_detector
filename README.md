# Deep Learning Metric Detectors in General Relativity
Author: Ryota Katsube,  Wai-Hong Tam, Masahiro Hotta, and Yasusada Nambu

## Overview
In this repository, you can download four python notebooks that reproduce the results in our paper, 
[Deep Learning Metric Detectors in General Relativity] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03006).

## Description
There are four python notebooks.
The following three files are associated with DL ESTIMATION OF COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT IN ANTI-DE SITTER SPACETIME in the paper.

predict_lambda_using_xy_image.ipynb  
predict_lambda_using_time_and_angle.ipynb  
predict_lambda_using_local_transformed_data.ipynb  

The following file is associated with DL ESTIMATION OF ASYMPTOTIC SYMMETRY CHARGES IN ADS in the paper.  
BHcharge.ipynb

## Requirement
If you have a google account, you can easily run the files in google colab.
Note that in the python notebooks, there are three code cells in which the generated dataset is saved or loaded as npz files,
but if you do not want to save the dataset in your google drive, you can skip them. 
It takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour to run all the codes in each file in google colab.

Note that we shall not be responsible for any loss, damages and troubles which come from using our files.
